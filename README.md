## Hi there 👋
I'm Joseph! A Data Scientist and ML Engineer with an academic education in Spatial Development Engineering and an extensive knowledge of GIS technologies.

### About me 💡
I started my career working with image data containing geographic information and I am highly aware of sensor geometries and the impact they have on spatial accuracy.

Lately, I am interested in designing and developing solutions utilizing all kinds of data sources in other domains, and I'm experienced in encoding all sorts of information for model consumption.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on msi2slstr, a prototype data-fusion python package for satellite images of the Copernicus programme.
